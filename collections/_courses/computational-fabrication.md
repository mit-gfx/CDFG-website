Formally designated computational fabrication, 6.807 provides a broad overview of both hardware and software for additive manufacturing. In particular, students are introduced to methods for parametric modeling of solid objects that take into account fabrication constraints. In the lab, they master computing models of physical objects using real-time 3D scanning. They also study and implement advanced physically-based simulation methods.  The students explore the kinematics of mechanisms, such as four-bar-linkages, and finite element methods in the context of deformable solids. These techniques are fundamental in the engineering community and are crucial for designing highly predictive tools for 3D print preview. Using these tools, many variations of a virtual solid object can be interactively analyzed without committing to fabrication.  The course also covers optimization methods that are applied to automate the design process.  After learning this basic toolset, students analyze many instances of recent computational fabrication systems that seamlessly blend interactive design, simulation, and optimization, for example, the interactive designing of printable automata.  In the second part of the semester, students work in groups on large open-ended projects. The primary goal of the class is to give students both a practical and a theoretical knowledge of every stage in the computational fabrication pipeline.

title: Presentations at Siggraph 2015
---

We have three papers accepted to ACM Siggraph 2015: "Data-driven finite elements for geometry and material design", "Fab forms: customizable objects for fabrication with validity and geometry caching", "MultiFab: a machine vision assisted platform for multi-material 3D printing." We will be also presenting a talk on "Interactive Robogami: Data-Driven Design for 3D Print and Fold Robots with Ground Locomotion" and a course on "[Computational Tools for 3D Printing](http://www.computational-fabrication.com/)".

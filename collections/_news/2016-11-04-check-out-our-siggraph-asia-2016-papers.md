---

We have 2 papers accepted to Siggraph Asia this year: [Computational Multicopter Design](computational-multicopter-design.html) presents an interactive system for computational design, optimization, and fabrication of multicopters, and [Stochastic Structural Analysis For Context-Aware Design And Fabrication](stochastic-structural-analysis-context-aware-design-and-fabrication.html) proposes failure probabilities as a semantically and mechanically meaningful measure of object fragility.

title: Two-scale topology optimization in the news!
---

[Bo Zhu](https://people.csail.mit.edu/boolzhu/)'s paper [Two-scale topology optimization with microstructures](http://people.csail.mit.edu/boolzhu/projects/topo.htm) was featured at the [front page](http://web.mit.edu/) of [MIT News](http://news.mit.edu/2017/designing-microstructure-3-d-printed-objects-0804) today! In this paper, Bo proposed a method that can efficiently genrate high-resolution 3D-printable structures with more than a trillion elements with just a regular computer.

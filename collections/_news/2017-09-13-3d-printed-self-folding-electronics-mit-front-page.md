title: 3D-printed self-folding electronics on MIT front page!
---

[Subramanian Sundaram](http://web.mit.edu/subras/www/)'s recent work [3D-printed self-folding electronics](http://web.mit.edu/subras/www/ACS_AMI_17.pdf) was selected as [Today's spotlight](http://news.mit.edu/2017/peel-and-go-printable-structures-fold-themselves-0913) on [MIT front page](http://web.mit.edu/) this morning! In this paper, Subra and his colleagues built a prototype self-folding printable device that includes electrical leads and a polymer “pixel” that changes from transparent to opaque when a voltage is applied to it.

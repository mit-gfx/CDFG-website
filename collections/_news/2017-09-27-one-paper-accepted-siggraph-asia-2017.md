title: One paper accepted at SIGGRAPH Asia 2017
---

Congratulations to [Liang Shi](liang-shi.html) on his newly accepted paper [Near-eye Light Field Holographic Rendering with Spherical Waves for Wide Field of View Interactive 3D Computer Graphics](near-eye-light-field-holographic-rendering-spherical-waves-wide-field-view-interactive-3d.html) at SIGGRAPH Asia this year! In this paper Liang and his colleagues at Nvidia present a light field-based CGH rendering pipeline allowing for reproduction of high-definition 3D scenes with continuous depth and support of intra-pupil view-dependent occlusion. Want to learn more?

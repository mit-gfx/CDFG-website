Our postdoctoral researcher [Petr Kellnhofer](https://people.csail.mit.edu/pkellnho/) received this year's [Eurographics Annual Award for Best PhD Thesis](https://www.eg.org/wp/eurographics-awards-programme/phd-award/) for his strong technical contribution in perceptual modeling for stereoscopic 3D by running dedicated perceptual studies, deriving new perceptual models from his findings, and integrating these models in computer graphics algorithms. Congratulations!

[Yuanming](http://taichi.graphics/me/)'s latest paper [ChainQueen](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01054) was accepted to ICRA 2019. In this paper, he presented a differentiable deformable body simulator that opens up lots of possibilities for efficient controller and geometry design algorithms in robotics. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IWD4iGIsB4) to see what amazining work can be done using his simulator!

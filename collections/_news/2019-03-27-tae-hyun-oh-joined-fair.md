After spending one and a half wonderful years in our lab, our very own Postdoctoral researcher, [Tae-Hyun Oh](http://thohkaistackr.wixsite.com/page), joined [Faceboook AI Research](https://research.fb.com/category/facebook-ai-research/), Cambridge, MA, which is located across the street. During his stay at MIT, Tae-Hyun has contributed to a wide range of research projects, including [Motion Magnification](learning-based-video-motion-magnification.html), [Soft Segmentation](semantic-soft-segmentation.html), [Speech2Face](speech2face-learning-face-behind-voice.html), and Inverse Knitting. Congratulations to Tae-Hyun, and wish him the best of luck in the future!

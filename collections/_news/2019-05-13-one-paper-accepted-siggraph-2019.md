title: One paper accepted to SIGGRAPH 2019

Our PhD student [Jie Xu](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/) will present his latest work "[Learning to Fly: Computational Controller Design for Hybrid UAVs with Reinforcement Learning](learning-fly-computational-controller-design-hybrid-uavs-reinforcement-learning.html)" at SIGGRAPH 2019 this summer. In this paper, Jie proposed a novel neural network controller design for hybrid UAVs, an aerial robot that is challenging to control due to its complex aerodynamic effects. His method allows us to directly apply a controller trained in simulation to real hybrid UAV hardware without any modification.

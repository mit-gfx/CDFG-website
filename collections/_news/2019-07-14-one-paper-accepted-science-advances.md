In [our latest work](../sites/cfg.mit.edu/files/SCI_ADV_19.pdf) published in Science Advances, our group presented an automated system that designs and 3-D prints complex robotic actuators which are optimized according to an enormous number of specifications. We demonstrate the system by fabricating actuators that show different black-and-white images at different angles. One of our actuators portrays a Vincent van Gogh portrait when laid flat and the famous Edvard Munch painting “The Scream” when tiled an angle. We also 3-D printed floating water lilies with petals equipped with arrays of actuators and hinges that fold up in response to magnetic fields run through conductive fluids.

[Alex](http://w-x.ch/)'s latest work [Knitting Skeletons: A Computer-Aided Design Tool for Shaping and Patterning of Knitted Garments](http://knitskel.csail.mit.edu/) is officially accepted to UIST 2019. In this paper, [Alex](http://w-x.ch/) and [Liane](http://www.lianemakatura.com/) present a novel interactive system for simple garment composition and surface patterning. Both casual users and advanced users can benefit from their system. Check out these [beautiful samples](http://knitskel.csail.mit.edu/) to explore the new possibility brought by their tool!

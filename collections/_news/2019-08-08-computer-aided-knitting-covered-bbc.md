During the past week, [Alex](http://w-x.ch/)'s two recent papers on knitting [Neural Inverse Knitting: From Images to Manufacturing Instructions](http://deepknitting.csail.mit.edu/) (ICML 19) and [Knitting Skeletons: Computer-Aided Design Tool for Shaping and Patterning of Knitted Garments](http://knitskel.csail.mit.edu/) (UIST 19) have received lots of media attention, including a recent interview from [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-49154285/how-designing-your-own-clothes-could-become-easier). The story is also widely reported by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/04/mit-researchers-are-working-on-ai-based-knitting-design-software-that-will-let-anyone-even-novices-make-their-own-clothes/), [7News Boston](https://whdh.com/news/mit-developing-software-to-help-amateur-knitters-design-patterns-for-machines-to-knit/), [Mashable](https://in.mashable.com/tech/5513/researchers-are-developing-ai-based-knitting-software-that-will-allow-anyone-to-make-their-own-cloth), [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2019/08/05/should-i-get-apple-card/), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2019/08/04/mit-csail-tackles-knitting-with-twin-ai-tools/), [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/05/the-morning-after-google-assistant-can-read-out-your-whatsapp-r/), [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/mit-breaks-new-ground-in-ai-with-knitting-yes-knitting/), [Geek](https://www.geek.com/tech/mits-ai-knitting-system-designs-creates-woven-garments-1798715/), [Market Research Finance](http://marketresearchfinance.com/2019/08/05/ai-powered-software-will-now-help-you-knit-garments/), [Interesting Engineering](https://interestingengineering.com/video/ai-created-by-mit-assists-knitters-to-design-and-create-a-woolly-hat-or-glove), [Fibre2Fashion](https://www.fibre2fashion.com/news/textiles-technology-news/mit-researchers-find-new-approach-to-streamline-knitting-251122-newsdetails.htm), and [MIT News](http://news.mit.edu/2019/computer-aided-knitting-mit-csail-0806).

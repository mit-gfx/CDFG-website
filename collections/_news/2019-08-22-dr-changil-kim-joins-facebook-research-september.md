Our very own Postdoctoral researcher [Changil Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/changil/) is joining Facebook in Seattle as a research scientist in September, after spending two and a half wonderful years in our lab. During his time in our lab, Changil has actively contributed to many research projects, including [motion magnification](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tiam/deepmag/), [replicating oil painting](https://people.csail.mit.edu/changil/deep-multispectral-painting-reproduction/), [speech to face](https://speech2face.github.io/), and [video processing](video-reflection-removal-through-spatio-temporal-optimization.html). Congratulations to Changil and wish him all the best in Seattle!

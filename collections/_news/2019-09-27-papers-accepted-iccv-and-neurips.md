Dr. Petr Kellnhofer's work "[Gaze360: Physically Unconstrained Gaze Estimation in the Wild](http://gaze360.csail.mit.edu/)" was accepted to ICCV 2019. In this paper, we present Gaze360, a large-scale gaze-tracking dataset and method for robust 3D gaze estimation in unconstrained images. Our proposed 3D gaze model extends existing models to include temporal information and to directly output an estimate of gaze uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate an application of our model for estimating customer attention in a supermarket setting. This paper was was in collaboration with Professor [Antonio Torralba](http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/)'s group and Toyota Research Institute.

The paper [Physical Realization Of Elastic Cloaking With A Polar Material](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.124.114301) was recently accepted to Physical Review Letters (PRL). In this paper, [Wan Shou](https://showone90.wixsite.com/show) and [Beichen Li](http://cfg.mit.edu/content/beichen-li) collaborated with researchers at University of Missouri and Dalian University of Technology to propose a novel elastic cloak by designing and fabricating a new class of polar materials with a distribution of body torque that exhibits asymmetric stresses. The work sets a precedent in the field of transformation elasticity and should find applications in mechanical stress shielding and stealth technologies.

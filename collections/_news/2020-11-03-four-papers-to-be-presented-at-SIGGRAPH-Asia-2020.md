CDFG members will be presenting 4 new papers at SIGGRAPH Asia 2020, spanning areas such as robot design, material appearance, and fluidic device optimization. Tao Du, Kui Wu, and Andy Spielberg will present their work on [Functional Optimization of Fluidic Devices with Differentiable Stokes Flow](https://cdfg.mit.edu/publications/diff-stokes-flow). On the robotics side, CDFG members Allan Zhao, Jie Xu, Mina Konaković Luković, and Andrew Spielberg will present [RoboGrammar: Graph Grammar for Terrain-Optimized Robot Design](https://cdfg.mit.edu/publications/robogrammar-graph-grammar-for-terrain-optimized-robot-design). Lastly, we present two papers focused on material modelling and appearance. PhD students Liang Shi and Beichen Li tackle digital material synthesis in their paper [MATch: Differentiable Material Graphs for Procedural Material Capture](https://cdfg.mit.edu/publications/match), while researchers Michal Piovarči and Michael Foshey investigate physical material properties with their paper, [Towards Spatially Varying Gloss Reproduction for 3D Printing](https://cdfg.mit.edu/publications/spatially-varying-gloss).

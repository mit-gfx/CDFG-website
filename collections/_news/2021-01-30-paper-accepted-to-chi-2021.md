CDFG members [Yiyue Luo](https://sites.google.com/view/yiyue-luo/home) and [Kui Wu](https://people.csail.mit.edu/kuiwu/) will present their technical paper [KnitUI: Fabricating Interactive and Sensing Textiles with Machine Knitting](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kuiwu/stitchmodeling#knitui) at CHI 2021. In their paper, Yiyue and Kui present KnitUI, a novel, accessible machine-knitted user interface based on resistive pressure sensing. They demonstrate KnitUI as a portable, deformable, washable, and customizable interactive and sensing platform. It obtains diverse applications, including wearable user interfaces, tactile sensing wearables, and artificial robot skin. Pleaes check out the [project webpage](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kuiwu/stitchmodeling#knitui) for more details, and feel free to reach out to Yiyue and Kui at CHI this year!

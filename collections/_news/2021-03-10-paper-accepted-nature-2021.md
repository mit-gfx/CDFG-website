CDFG members [Liang Shi](http://people.csail.mit.edu/liangs/), [Beichen Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beichen-li-ba9b34106/), [Changil Kim](https://changilkim.com), [Petr Kellnhofer](https://kellnhofer.xyz)'s paper [Towards Real-time Photorealistic 3D Holography with Deep Neural Networks](http://cgh.csail.mit.edu) is published at Nature 2021. In their paper, the team presents the first deep-learning-based system for real-time photorealistic 3D hologram synthesis. The paper advances both physically-based methods and introduces the first large-scale 3D hologram dataset. Please check out this [summary video](https://youtu.be/NOujMHH3LAU) for more details!

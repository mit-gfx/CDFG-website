The paper [Learning Human-environment Interactions using Conformal Tactile Textiles](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-021-00558-0) has been published in Nature Electronics 2021. In this paper, we present a full-body tactile textile for the study of human activities. We capture diverse human–environment interactions and demonstrate the capability of our platform to classify humans’ sitting poses, motions and other interactions with the environment, recover dynamic whole-body poses, reveal environmental spatial information and discover biomechanical signatures.

CDFG member [Jie Xu](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/)'s paper [Multi-Objective Graph Heuristic Search for Terrestrial Robot Design](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jiex/) has been accepted to ICRA 2021. In this paper, Jie and CDFG members [Andrew Spielberg](http://www.andrewspielberg.com/) and Allan Zhao present efficient methods for co-designing rigid terrestrial robots' control and morphology (including discrete topology) with multiple objectives. Jie will be presenting this work at ICRA 2021 in June.

CDFG member [Tao Du](http://people.csail.mit.edu/taodu/)'s paper [Underwater Soft Robot Modeling and Control with Differentiable Simulation](http://people.csail.mit.edu/taodu/) has been accepted to IEEE RA-L. In this work, [Tao](http://people.csail.mit.edu/taodu/), [Josie Hughes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CXfveikAAAAJ&hl=en), and CDFG UROP student Sebastien Wah demonstrate the power of a differentiable simulator in the task of planning the motion and narrowing the reality gap of a real-world, starfish-like soft robot. The paper will be online in the incoming weeks.

CDFG member [Yiyue Luo](https://yyueluo.com/), [Michael Foshey](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/michael-foshey), and Wan Shou's paper [Intelligent Carpet: Inferring 3D Human Pose from Tactile Signals](https://yyueluo.com/) has been accepted to CVPR 2021. In this paper, we present a 3D human pose estimation approach using vision as supersion and the pressure maps recorded by a large-scale tactile carpet as input. This work is in collobaration with Professor [Antonio Torralba](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/torralbalab/)'s group.

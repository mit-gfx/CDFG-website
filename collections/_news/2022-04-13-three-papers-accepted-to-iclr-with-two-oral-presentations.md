Three papers authored by CDFG members have been accepted to ICLR 2022, and two have been selected for an oral presentation! Pingchuan Ma and Tao Du will present their work “RISP: Rendering-Invariant State Predictor with Differentiable Simulation and Rendering for Cross-Domain Parameter Estimation.” Minghao Guo and Beichen Li will also present their paper, “Data-Efficient Graph Grammar Learning for Molecular Generation”. The third accepted paper, authored by CDFG member Jie Xu, is titled “Accelerated Policy Learning with Parallel Differentiable Simulation”. Congratulations to all the paper authors!

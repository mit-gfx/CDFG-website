CDFG members Yunsheng Tian and Yifei Li’s paper “JoinABLe: Learning Bottom-up Assembly of Parametric CAD Joints” has been accepted to CVPR 2022. In this paper, we propose a learning-based method that assembles parts together to form joints without the help of object class labels or human guidance, and a large dataset containing CAD assemblies with rich information.

Congratulations to CDFG member Yiyue Luo, who was recently named to the Forbes 30 under 30 list! Her inspiring work creates smart textiles that can add sensing and other technology into knitted fabrics. She has developed machine-knitted tactile sensing garments, like vests, socks, and gloves, that can provide real-time data on physical interactions, like a pair of socks could detect a fall or a condition like Parkinson's non-intrusively.

Congratulations Yiyue!

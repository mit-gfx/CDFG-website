Parametric computer-aided design (CAD) is a standard paradigm used for the design of manufactured objects. CAD designers perform modeling operations, such as sketch and extrude, to form a construction sequence that makes up a final design. Despite the pervasiveness of parametric CAD and growing interest from the research community, a dataset of human designed 3D CAD construction sequences has not been available to-date. In this paper we present the Fusion 360 Gallery reconstruction dataset and environment for learning CAD reconstruction. We provide a dataset of 8,625 designs, comprising sequential sketch and extrude modeling operations, together with a complementary environment called the Fusion 360 Gym, to assist with performing CAD reconstruction. We outline a standard CAD reconstruction task, together with evaluation metrics, and present results from a novel method using neurally guided search to recover a construction sequence from raw geometry.

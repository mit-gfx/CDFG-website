Additive manufacturing has become one of the forefront technologies in fabrication, enabling products impossible to manufacture before. Although many materials exist for additive manufacturing, most suffer from performance trade-offs. Current materials are designed with inefficient human-driven intuition-based methods, leaving them short of optimal solutions. We propose a machine learning approach to accelerating the discovery of additive manufacturing materials with optimal trade-offs in mechanical performance. A multiobjective optimization algorithm automatically guides the experimental design by proposing how to mix primary formulations to create better performing materials. The algorithm is coupled with a semiautonomous fabrication platform to substantially reduce the number of performed experiments and overall time to solution. Without prior knowledge of the primary formulations, the proposed methodology autonomously uncovers 12 optimal formulations and enlarges the discovered performance space 288 times after only 30 experimental iterations. This methodology could be easily generalized to other material design systems and enable automated discovery.

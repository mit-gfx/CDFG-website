This work describes a computer system for authoring dance shows. The system can be used both as a mechanism to synthesize virtual group performances and as a tool for interactive design and visualization of real choreographies. To this end, we use as input motion capture of dance sequences that are synchronized with an underlying musical composition. We adapt motion synthesis methods for use in combination with a musical track. The authoring system provides methods for controlling group movement of dancers on stage, such as creating formations and following trajectories. Our integrated platform supports collaboration between artists, allowing the show to naturally evolve from iterative contributions from dancers, musicians and choreographers.

Currently, we are witnessing the emergence of computer-controlled output devices that provide revolutionary possibilities for fabricating complex, functional, multi-material objects with stunning optical and mechanical properties that cannot be manufactured using any other method. Access to 3D printers is becoming ubiquitous through affordable 3D printers and online 3D printing services, accelerating the growth of a vibrant maker community. Leveraging the potential of this technology requires efficient methods for content creation.

We present the first algorithm for designing volumetric Michell Trusses. Our method uses a parametrization approach to generate trusses made of structural elements aligned with the primary direction of an object's stress field. Such trusses exhibit high strength-to-weight ratios. We demonstrate the structural robustness of our designs via a posteriori physical simulation. We believe our algorithm serves as an important complement to existing structural optimization tools and as a novel standalone design tool itself.

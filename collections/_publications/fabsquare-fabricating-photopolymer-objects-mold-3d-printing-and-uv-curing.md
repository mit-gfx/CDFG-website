title: 'FabSquare: Fabricating Photopolymer Objects by Mold 3D Printing and UV Curing'
---

The FabSquare system fabricates objects by casting photopolymers inside a 3D printed mold. The molds are printed with UV-transparent materials to allow for UV photopolymerization. Because it uses simple and inexpensive hardware, FabSquare is suitable for ordinary users in nonspecialized labs.

This manuscript completes the analysis of our SIGGRAPH 2013 paper \[Levin et al. 2013], ”Fabricating BRDFs at High Spatial Resolution Using Wave Optics” in which photolithography fabrication was used for manipulating reflectance effects. While photolithography allows for precise reflectance control, it is costly to fabricate. Here we explore an inexpensive alternative to micro-fabrication, in the form of metallic powders. Such powders are readily available at a variety of particle sizes and morphologies. Using an analysis similar to the micro-fabrication paper, we provide guidelines for the relation between the particles’ shape and size and the reflectance functions they can produce.

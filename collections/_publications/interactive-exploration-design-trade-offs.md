Typical design for manufacturing applications requires simultaneous optimization of conflicting performance objectives: Design variations that improve one performance metric may decrease another performance metric. In these scenarios, there is no unique optimal design but rather a set of designs that are optimal for different trade-offs (called Pareto-optimal). In this work, we propose a novel approach to discover the Pareto front, allowing designers to navigate the landscape of compromises efficiently. Our approach is based on a first-order approximation of the Pareto front, which allows entire neighborhoods rather than individual points on the Pareto front to be captured. In addition to allowing for efficient discovery of the Pareto front and the corresponding mapping to the design space, this approach allows us to represent the entire trade-off manifold as a small collection of patches that comprise a high-quality and piecewise-smooth approximation. We illustrate how this technique can be used for navigating performance trade-offs in computer-aided design (CAD) models.

This work presents a novel system for simple garment composition and surface patterning which aims to allow anyone to design customized knitted garments. Our tool combines ideas from CAD software and image editing: it allows the composition of (1) new parametric knitted primitives, and (2) stitch pattern layers with different resampling behaviours. The underlying course-based representation enables complex customization with automated layout and real-time patterning feedback. We show a variety of garments and patterns created with our tool, as well as our ability to transfer shape and pattern customizations across users. Finally, we make our design tool available to stimulate research in computational knitting.

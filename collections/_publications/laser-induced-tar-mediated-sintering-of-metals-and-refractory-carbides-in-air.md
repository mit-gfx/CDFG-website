“Just Accepted” manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication. They are posted

online prior to technical editing, formatting for publication and author proofing. The American Chemical

Society provides “Just Accepted” as a service to the research community to expedite the dissemination

of scientific material as soon as possible after acceptance. “Just Accepted” manuscripts appear in

full in PDF format accompanied by an HTML abstract. “Just Accepted” manuscripts have been fully

peer reviewed, but should not be considered the official version of record. They are citable by the

Digital Object Identifier (DOI®). “Just Accepted” is an optional service offered to authors. Therefore,

the “Just Accepted” Web site may not include all articles that will be published in the journal. After

a manuscript is technically edited and formatted, it will be removed from the “Just Accepted” Web

site and published as an ASAP article. Note that technical editing may introduce minor changes

to the manuscript text and/or graphics which could affect content, and all legal disclaimers and

ethical guidelines that apply to the journal pertain. ACS cannot be held responsible for errors or

consequences arising from the use of information contained in these “Just Accepted” manuscripts.

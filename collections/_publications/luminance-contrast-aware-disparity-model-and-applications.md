title: A Luminance-Contrast-Aware Disparity Model and Applications
---

Binocular disparity is one of the most important depth cues used by the human visual system (HVS). Recently developed stereo-perception models allow us to successfully manipulate disparity in order to improve viewing comfort, depth discrimination as well as stereo content compression and display. Nonetheless, all existing models neglect the substantial influence of luminance on stereo perception. Our work is the first to account for the interplay of luminance contrast (magnitude/frequency) and disparity and our model predicts the human response to complex stereo-luminance images. Besides improving existing disparity-model applications (e.g., difference metrics or compression), our approach offers new possibilities, such as joint luminance contrast and disparity manipulation or the optimization of auto-stereoscopic content. We validate our results in a user study, which also reveals the advantage of considering luminance contrast and its significant impact on disparity manipulation techniques.

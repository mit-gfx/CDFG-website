[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/three-dimensional-printing "Learn more about Additive manufacturing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")Additive Manufacturing (also known as 3D printing) has enabled the customized fabrication of objects with complex geometries and functionalities in mechanical and electrical properties. AM technologies commonly use polymers and composites and have been advancing in a variety of industrial and emerging applications. Despite recent progress in 3D printing of polymer composites, many challenges, such as the suboptimal quality of manufactured products and limited material available for 3D printing, need to be addressed for the broad adoption of additively manufactured polymer composites. This review first provides a brief history of AM technologies along with 3D printing polymers. Subsequently, we discuss the state-of-the-art for the design of polymers and filling materials, the principles of AM processes, and emerging applications of 3D printed polymer and composites. Finally, we share our outlook of potential problems and challenges presented in AM of polymer composites, which might lead to future research directions.

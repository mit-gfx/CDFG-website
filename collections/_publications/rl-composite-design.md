Advancements in additive manufacturing have enabled design and fabrication of materials and structures not previously realizable. In particular, the design space of composite materials and structures has vastly expanded, and the resulting size and complexity has challenged traditional design methodologies, such as brute force exploration and one factor at a time (OFAT) exploration, to find optimum or tailored designs. To address this challenge, supervised machine learning approaches have emerged to model the design space using curated training data; however, the selection of the training data is often determined by the user. In this work, we develop and utilize a Reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for the design of composite structures which avoids the need for user-selected training data. For a 5Ã—5 composite design space comprised of soft and compliant blocks of constituent material, we find that using this approach, the model can be trained using 2.78% of the total design space consists of 225 design possibilities. Additionally, the developed RL-based framework is capable of finding designs at a success rate exceeding 90%. The success of this approach motivates future learning frameworks to utilize RL for the design of composites and other material systems.

Cloth manipulation is a common action in humans that many animated characters in interactive simulations are not able to perform due to its complexity. In this paper we focus on dressing-up, a common action involving cloth. We identify the steps required to perform the task and describe the systems responsible for each of them. Our results show a character that is able to put on a scarf and react to cloth collision and overstretching events. Based on our experiments, we recommend a number of changes to a cloth-character model that would expand the capabilities of such interactions

title: Computational Design
excerpt: >+
  Our lab has a strong interest in developing a holistic computational solution
  for designing and optimizing cyber-physical systems (e.g., robots). Our
  research topics include:


  1.	Proposing continuous, discrete, or hybrid methods for design-space representation and parametrization.

  2.	Developing fast, reliable, and differentiable physics simulators for efficient evaluation of a design.

  3.	Researching novel numerical optimization techniques for co-optimizing a cyber-physical system's body 
          and brain.
  4.	Exploring designs efficiently and effectively in the context of multi-objective performance metrics.

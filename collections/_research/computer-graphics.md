title: Computer Graphics
excerpt: Our group has a strong track record of publishing graphics research
  papers at top-tier conferences (SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia) and journals (TOG).
  Some topics that we are currently interested in include 1) Physics simulation
  of all kinds and its applications in machine learning, robotics, and computer
  vision, 2) Computer-aided design, shape models, shape analysis, and especially
  their industry-level applications, 3) Appearance modeling, (procedural)
  material design, modeling, rendering, and visualization, and of course, 4)
  computational design and fabrication of cyber-physical systems.

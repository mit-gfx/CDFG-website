title: Computer Vision
excerpt: >
  Our group actively works on different vision problems in the following
  domains: 1); Gaze tracking; 2) Novel view synthesis for 3D displays; 3)
  Multimodal learning (i.e., voice-face, pressure map-pose); 4) Computational
  photography (i.e., motion magnification, semantic soft segmentation); 5)
  Datasets for new learning tasks (CAD models, holograms, gaze, flash/no-flash
  photographs). Recent works have been published in ICCV, ECCV, CVPR, ICML, and
  NeurlPS.

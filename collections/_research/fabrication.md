title: Fabrication
excerpt: "Our research in fabrication explores new types of fabrication
  processes and systems that will have a broad impact on how humans design and
  build things. We combine computational design, machine learning to model,
  understand, and extend fabrication processes such as additive manufacturing,
  machine knitting, and conventional manufacturing processes. Our recent
  research in this area has included developing multi-material manufacturing
  systems to create 3D shapes out of high-performance functional and structural
  materials and new manufacturing methods to create garments that sense and
  classify human activity.   "

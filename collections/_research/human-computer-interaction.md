title: Human-Computer Interaction
excerpt: "Our main recent HCI endeavors center around (1) digital tools for
  fabrications and (2) new user applications harnessing functional materials. By
  developing new digital tools, we are interested in how users can create more
  complex physical artifacts while enabling the customization of form,
  appearance and function. Recent works include the development of novel
  workflows for programming weft knitting machines, and the user authoring of
  complex digital materials for 3D printing. Furthermore, we are developing
  custom yarns that enable functional applications such as active on-body force
  sensing and human-machine / machine-environment interactions. "

* Tools and user interfaces to simplify design and fabrication (3d printing and weft knitting machines),
* Crowdsourcing of complex design tasks (video segmentation).

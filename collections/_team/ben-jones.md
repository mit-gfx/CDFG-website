[**Ben Jones**](http://bentodjones.com/) joined CDFG in 2024 after completing his PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington advised by [Adriana Schulz](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~adriana/), and Bachelors of Science degrees in Physics and Mathematics and Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College. His research interests are broad, and focus on applying computation to support invention and discovery. Currently Ben explores applying machine learning to design and proof synthesis, and in the past has worked on parametric CAD systems, automated knitting, distributed systems, computational microscopy, and space-based solar power. Outside the lab Ben can be found social dancing, bouldering, and playing guitar (mutually exclusive activities).

**[Buttercup Foshey](/buttercup)** is a 5 year old Belgian Tervuren/Poodle mix. She joined CDFG in 2017, after dropping out of Service Dog training to pursue her real passion: research! Her research interests include HCI (Hound-Couch Interaction), neural-network-based facial recognition (gatekeeping the lab and barking at unfamiliar faces!) and biomimetic soft robot autonomous locomotion in cluttered environments (wandering around the lab space!). She has left her bark at top-tier machine learning conferences including NeurIPS and ICML.

[**Michael Sun**](https://michaelsuntech.wordpress.com/) joined the group in the summer of 2023. He received his BS and MS from Stanford University in 2022, where he worked with Jure Leskovec and Percy Liang. He is interested in how AI can generate better graph-structured objects — which represent molecules, social networks, materials, buildings, etc. — by learning to reverse engineer existing ones and combining knowledge from pretrained models.

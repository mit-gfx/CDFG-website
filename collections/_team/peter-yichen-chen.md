**[Peter Yichen Chen](https://peterchencyc.com)** completed his CS PhD from Columbia, advised by [Eitan Grinspun](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~eitan/). Before that, he was a Sherwood-Prize-winning math undergrad from UCLA, working with [Joey Teran](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jteran/). Peter is interested in the intersection of physics simulation and machine learning. Outside of research, Peter is a foodie. If he is not consuming food himself, he is probably watching mukbang videos.

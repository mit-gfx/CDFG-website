**Sami Alsheikh** joined the CDFG in the Fall 2015 as a SuperUROP! His research focused on using newly developed radar technologies to understand different environments. Radar offers advantages over video because it doesn’t require light and has the potential to pick up on additional characteristics such as texture or material properties. Sami's work involves taking readings with small, new high-frequency radar chips, and exploring different analysis methods to derive meaning from the data.

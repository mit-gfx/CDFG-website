[Wenqiang (Winston) Chen](https://people.csail.mit.edu/winstonchen/) is a postdoctoral associate at MIT CSAIL, working with [Wojciech Matusik](https://cdfg.mit.edu/wojciech) and [Dina Katabi](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dina/). He received his PhD from the University of Virginia, working with Professor [John Stankovic](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/john-stankovic). His research lies at the intersection of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), ubiquitous and mobile sensing, and human-computer interaction (HCI). In particular, his research specializes in developing Vibrational Interaction (VibInt) systems to perceive and infer information from human bodies, robots, and environments through vibrations. VibInt has been proposed to advance a wide variety of research areas, such as wearable interactions, robotics, smart health, smart homes, privacy and security. He has published his research in various top conferences and journals (e.g., Mobicom, Ubicomp, and Transactions on Mobile Computing), obtained five patents, and won the IEEE SECON 2018 Best Paper Award and the ACM SenSys 2020 Best Demo Award. Winston is also a co-founder of VibInt AI, a startup working on wearable devices using VibInt technologies, and his research IPs have been used in thousands of commodity devices.

The MERL BRDF database contains reflectance functions of 100 different materials. Each reflectance function is stored as a densely measured Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF).
MERL provides this data only for research or academic use. Sample code to read the data is included with the database. Note that parameterization of theta-half has changed.

### Biography

Wojciech Matusik is a Professor of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/) at the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](http://www.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT, where he leads the [Computational Design and Fabrication Group](http://cfg.mit.edu/) and is a member of the [Computer Graphics Group](http://graphics.csail.mit.edu/). Before coming to MIT, he worked at Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories, Adobe Systems, and Disney Research Zurich. He studied computer graphics at MIT and received his PhD in 2003. He also received a BS in EECS from the University of California at Berkeley in 1997 and MS in EECS from MIT in 2001. His research interests are in computer graphics, computational design and fabrication, computer vision, robotics, and hci. In 2004, he was named one of the world's top 100 young innovators by MIT's Technology Review Magazine. In 2009, he received the Significant New Researcher Award from ACM Siggraph. In 2012, Matusik received the DARPA Young Faculty Award and he was named a Sloan Research Fellow. In 2014, he received Ruth and Joel Spira Award for Excellence in Teaching.
